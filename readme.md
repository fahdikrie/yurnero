# Hiya!
This is a repository that contains all of my takes on coding problems from hackerrank/leetcode/codeforces.

Why "yurnero", you might ask? I felt like going with a catchy consists-of-only-one-word repo name (as most of my other repos). And the phrase "coding practice" instantly reminds me of Dota 2's Juggernaut [sayings](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dota2_gamepedia/images/a/a1/Vo_juggernaut_jugsc_arc_level_05.mp3/): <em>"With practice, comes strength!"</em>. Cool, right?
